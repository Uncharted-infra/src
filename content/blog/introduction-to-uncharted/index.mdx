## The Problem with Planning Travel

We've all been there. You want to take a trip — maybe a long weekend in a city you've never visited, maybe a two-week adventure across Southeast Asia. So you open a dozen browser tabs. You compare flights on one site, hotels on another, read blog posts from three years ago, and try to stitch together an itinerary in a Google Doc that slowly becomes unreadable.

By the time you're done "planning," you're already exhausted, and you haven't gone anywhere yet.

Travel should be exciting. The planning part? It shouldn't feel like a second job.

## What is Uncharted?

Uncharted is an AI travel agent that you can talk to like a real person. You tell it what you want — a weekend trip from Chicago, a 5-day Italy itinerary, hotels in Kyoto under $150/night — and it handles the rest.

It's not a search engine that returns ten blue links. It's not a chatbot that gives you generic advice. Uncharted actually does the work:

- **Explores** destinations based on your preferences, budget, and schedule
- **Plans** real itineraries with day-by-day structure
- **Books** flights, hotels, and experiences — handling the logistics so you don't have to

Think of it as having a travel agent in your pocket, available 24/7, who actually understands what you want.

## How It Works

Using Uncharted is as simple as sending a message. There's no complicated UI to learn, no forms to fill out. Just type what's on your mind:

> "Weekend trips from San Francisco under $500"

> "Plan a 10-day Japan trip for two people in April"

> "Find me a boutique hotel in Barcelona near the Gothic Quarter"

Uncharted takes your request and goes to work. It searches real options, compares prices, builds an itinerary, and comes back with something you can actually use — not just a list of links to sort through yourself.

### The Three Phases

Every trip goes through three natural phases, and Uncharted helps with all of them:

#### Explore

This is the fun part. You're curious, maybe you don't even know where you want to go. Uncharted helps you discover destinations, understand what makes them special, and figure out the right fit for your mood, budget, and calendar.

#### Plan

Once you've decided on a destination, Uncharted shifts into planning mode. It builds a real itinerary — flights, accommodations, activities, restaurant recommendations — all organized day by day. No more Google Doc chaos.

#### Book

This is where most tools fall apart. Uncharted doesn't just recommend — it actually handles reservations, confirmations, and tickets. The annoying logistics that make people dread travel planning? Gone.

## Why We Built This

The travel industry is full of tools, but most of them are built for a different era. Aggregators show you options but make you do all the work. Travel agents are expensive and hard to reach. And "AI assistants" from existing platforms are usually just wrappers around the same search engines you were already using.

We wanted something different. Something that combines the convenience of modern AI with the reliability of a real travel agent. Something you can trust to handle the details while you focus on being excited about your trip.

## What's Next

We're just getting started. In the coming months, we'll be expanding Uncharted's capabilities:

- **Real-time rebooking** — flight cancelled? Uncharted rebooks you before you even notice
- **On-trip support** — restaurant closed? Need a pharmacy? Ask Uncharted while you're there
- **Group coordination** — planning with friends shouldn't require a project manager
- **Budget tracking** — know exactly what you're spending, in real time

Travel should feel like an adventure, not an administrative burden. That's what we're building toward.
